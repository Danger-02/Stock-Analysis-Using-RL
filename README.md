# Stock-Analysis-Using-RL

SANDS OF COMMERCE

Our project aims to develop a reinforcement learning-based model to predict stock prices using historical data and key financial indicators. The model will analyze market trends and make decisions on whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock based on fundamental analysis as well as technical analysis. We utilize deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize trading strategies. This project bridges machine learning with financial analysis, providing a powerful tool for stock market predictions.
